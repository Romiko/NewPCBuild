# Optional: Clean NVIDIA Driver Install

1. Download the latest NVIDIA driver (Game Ready or Studio) for your GPU.
2. **Disconnect the internet** to stop Windows Update sneaking an older driver.
3. Boot to Safe Mode and run **DDU** (Display Driver Uninstaller) to remove old drivers.
4. Reboot normally, run the NVIDIA installer with **Clean install** checked (or use NVCleanstall to trim extras).
5. Re-enable internet.
